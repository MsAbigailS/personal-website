        description: " My daily task was to teach children ages 6-17 computer programming through Scratch, JavaScript, Lua, and Arduino robotics. I had also monitored safety procedures, graded assignments, and provided both one-on-one and group instruction. I had also scheduled, developed, and lead material in Scratch, JavaScript, Lua, Python, and Arduino for day and week camps, night events, Holiday specials, and Girl Scout lessons. The material I had created was used at not only our location, but our sister location in Spring Cypress, Texas. Whenever the manager was unavailable, I both sent and responded to emails, initiated and responded to calls, booked and conducted tours, and advertised our events. I had also monitored employee conduct and communicated issues or areas of improvement to provide the best experience possible to our students and families.",
